A fire extinguishing car using Arduino is a robotic vehicle designed to detect and extinguish small fires autonomously. This project combines the use of sensors, motors, and a water or extinguishing agent spraying mechanism, all controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, to navigate towards and eliminate flames effectively.
